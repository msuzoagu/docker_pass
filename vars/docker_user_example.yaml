# Ideally variables should be defined in
# 1 place. Personally, I define almost 
# all variables in a top level file that
# relies on an applications environment 
# Example: 
#         test/group_vars/all.yaml
# contains variables for test env
#
# This allows me to make use of role vars
# to overwrite variables that need to be 
# overwritten.
